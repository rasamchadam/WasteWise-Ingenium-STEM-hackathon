# WasteWise-Ingenium-STEM-hackathon
This repository includes a comprehensive Google Docs file detailing my project. It has my code, screenshots, and other relevant materials to effectively convey my project's features and functionality.
In my country, many people do not put waste into the correct bins allocated for them. This becomes extremely cumbersome to sort and in the end they are just sent to landfills. I wanted to make something that resolves this issue, hence, I made an AI which uses computer vision to sort out waste types, even telling the user how to dispose of the waste correctly. This could really impact the world in a good way if implemented on a large scale (for example, put the waste in front of a dustbin and the dustbin tells you how to dispose of it etc) . Many ideas have been proposed about a smart dustbin, but all of them seemed too complicated in my view. This is the simplest way one can create the system used in a smart dustbin. 

Opening the project!

To Open the project,from the given link (https://mblock.makeblock.com/project/3328581 ) click on source code. This way you can get the access to the project with codes and teachable training model, and see the code in action.

By clicking on the green flag symbol you can start the project. Just show the object in front of the camera from the waste categories and the AI project will sense, sort and tell you the best disposal methods in seconds!
